# Ansible roles for CIAO
This is an example of a playbook to deploy CIAO using ansible.

---
## Prework

### Access
Ansible requires that the user running the playbook has passwordless ssh access
from the deployment machine to the managed nodes and passwordless sudo privileges
on both the managed nodes and deployment machine.

### Requirements

#### CIAO nodes
* Ansible requirements can be found
[here](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#managed-node-requirements),
also check requirements for [fedora](doc/requirements.md#fedora).
* CIAO can be installed in ClearLinux, Fedora 24 and Ubuntu 16.04.
CIAO dependencies will be installed automatically
* If running behind a proxy server read [this](doc/requirements.md#proxies)

#### Deployment machine
The deployment machine can be any Linux OS as long as it has the following requirements installed.

NOTE: In ClearLinux, all the requirements can be installed with the following bundles:

    sudo swupd bundle-add sysadmin-hostmgmt go-basic python-openstack-clients os-core-dev

###### Install Ansible
The required version of ansible is 2.1 or later. Install ansible in your distribution as described in [Installing ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)

###### Install ansible roles dependencies
This playbook make use of roles that requires extra dependencies. These dependencies
are usually outdated in the OS package manager and is recommended to install them from pip.

    sudo pip install netaddr docker-py python-keystoneclient

###### Install Go
To build ciao from sources the deployment machine requires golang to be installed.
Install the latest release of go for your distribution as described in
[Installing Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

---

## Configuration

### ansible-galaxy
Install the required roles from ansible-galaxy

    sudo ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

### Edit the [hosts](hosts) file according to your cluster setup
```ini
[controllers]
controller.example.com

[networks]
network.example.com

[computes]
compute1.example.com
compute2.example.com
compute3.example.com
```

Optionally edit [group_vars/all](group_vars/all) file to change default passwords and other settings

---

### Run the playbook

    ansible-playbook -i hosts ciao.yml

---

## NOTES:
### A note on docker hostname resolution
This playbook uses docker containers to start the [identity service](https://hub.docker.com/r/clearlinux/keystone/) and [ciao-webui](https://hub.docker.com/r/clearlinux/ciao-webui/).

Docker containers uses /etc/resolv.conf on the host machine filtering any localhost
address since 'localhost' is not accesible from the container. If after this filtering
there is no nameserver entries in the containers /etc/resolv.conf the daemon adds
public Google DNS Servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) to the containers DNS configuration.

This situation can be caused by NetworkManager which automatically populates /etc/resolv.conf
and has an option to configure a local caching nameserver. If this is your case you can comment
the line "dns=dnsmasq" from /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

Make sure the hosts running docker (controller and compute nodes) have a correctly
configured dns server that can resolve the cluster nodes names.
